# Media-Library-NET-Core

You just spoke with your client, who's in charge of a small multi-media library.
They used to have a small program, written in 1998, to handle their loans... but since the last Windows update it's no longer working.

He wants you to develop a new software, but it needs to be able to read the old archive.
Here's what he said to you:

"Aaah, those damn machines. The day before it was working and then, BAM, that nasty error message... and we cannot run it anymore.
I need you to develop another one.

It has to handle all of the media we are dealing with: Movies, Albums, Books and Videogames.
We used to have a lot of information there... Titles, authors, release date... and other things like distributor, 
or total length, number of pages, multiplayer capabilities.. stuff like that.

You know, we need this application to be able to show us the list of media sorted by all those different properties.
And also to show them only by type, like if I want to order them by number of pages of course I only want to see books.

It's all in that file that I sent you, that Media_Library_Database.csv.

So first make sure you import all of our data from there, and then provide me a program that I can use to see items sorted by the properties I want..
You see, the old program... it usually asked which kind of media we want to see, and then what property they should be ordered by.

Ah, I was about to forget: in that file we have the information about our loans.. so in each media listed there's also a value
that tells if we lent that item or not.
    
And if you do a good job, maybe I will pay you even more to develop a Website to allow our guests to perform the same operations from home!"
